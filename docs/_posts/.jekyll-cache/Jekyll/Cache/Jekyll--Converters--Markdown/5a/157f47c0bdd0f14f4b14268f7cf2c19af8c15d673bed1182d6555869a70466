I"<p>The aim of the <em>n</em>-body problem is to predict the motion of a system of bodies bound by a central potential field. In these situations all the interaction forces between the bodies are directly derivable from the potential, and usually follow some form of inverse relation to the distance between the bodies. The most commonly discussed example is the gravitational <em>n</em>-body problem, where the system is bound by a gravitational potential, and the motion is governed by the inverse-square force</p>

<p>\[
\begin{equation} 
\label{eqn:1}
	\v F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r_{12}^2} \hat{\boldsymbol r}_{12} 
\end{equation} 
\]</p>

<p>\[ \ddv r = \dd{r}{t} = \ddd{\v r}{t} \]</p>

<p>which describes its gravitational interaction with every other body in the system (Newtonâ€™s law of universal gravitation).</p>

<p>The challenge in solving the motion of any <em>n</em>-body system is dynamical complexity. As more bodies are included, the large number of interactions tends to make the motion extremely sensitive to initial conditions. As a result most <em>n</em>-body systems are dynamically unstable and have a high propensity to undergo chaotic motion. The only exception is the restricted case when $n=2$ (the classical two-body problem) which is the only case with stable behaviour for all configurations. For this reason only the two-body problem has been solved completely. For systems with $n \geq 3$ there is no general analytic solution to the problem, and the motion must generally be approximated using numerical methods (simulation).</p>
