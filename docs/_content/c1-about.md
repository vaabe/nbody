The goal of this project is to explore different numerical solution schemes for solving and analysing the dynamics of $n$-body systems. The main motivation here is academic: I want to build a framework for studying the geometrical and statistical properties of systems that are of interest in physics research.  

In particular, I want to incorporate aspects of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, as they offer valuable insights when studying quantum systems. in As part of this project I aim to explore how different numerical schemes affect the physical accuracy and stability of solutions. 

Emphasis on studying geometric and statistical aspects of the solution, such as attractors, bifurcations, and mean field theory.  

Also include components for modelling macroscopic systems, such as constraint resolution and collisions. 

This project started as a simple direct integration scheme for the _n_-body problem. As I added more and more components to the solution scheme to expand its scope, I decided to make a fully general engine.
