## properties of n-body systems

Most $n$-body problems assume the system is isolated, which means the total momentum is conserved. 

One property of isolated systems is that they are translationally invariant. The potential energy l

The centre of mass is an important property of an $n$-body system. Defined

\\[
\v R = \frac 1 M \sum_i^n m_i \v r_i 
\\] 

where $M$ is the total mass of the system, $M = \sum_i m_i$.  

The total momentum of an $n$-body system is:

\\[ 
\v P = \sum_i^n \v p_i = \sum_i^n m_i \dv r_i = M \dv R
\\] 

i.e. the total momentum of an n-body system is the same as the momentum of a single particle of mass $M$ moving at the centre of mass velocity. 

Moreover, the motion of the centre of mass depends on the external forces acting on the system

\\[ 
\dv P = M \ddv R = \v F_{\text{external}}
\\] 

This is why most $n$-body problems can be treated as point particles: if the body is small compared to the scope of its trajectory, its centre of mass is a good representation of its overall location. 

The angular momentum of a single particle is defined

\\[ 
\v l = \v r \times \v p
\\] 

The rate of change of angular momentum is

\\[ 
\dv l = (\v r \times \v p) = (\dv r \times \v p ) + (\v r \times \dv p) 
\\]

where the first term on the right disappears since $\v r \times \v p = \v r \times m \dv r = 0$ and the second term on the right can be replaced by $\v r \times \v F_{\text{ext}}$, so

\\[
\dv l = \v r \times \v F = \v \tau
\\] 

The rate of change of angular momentum is equal to the torque---specifically, the torque about the origin. 

In $n$-body problems this property is significant as most interaction forces are central forces---they act along a straight line between the bodies, If $\v r$ is parallel to $\v F$, then the product $\v r \times \v F$ is zero, and angular momentum is conserved. 

Thus angular momentum is also conserved in isolated $n$-body systems. 

This is also true for the total angular momentum of $n$ particles:

\\[
\v L = \sum_i^n \v l_i = \sum_i^n \v r_i \times \v p_i 
\\]

The rate of change of total angular momentum is

\\[
\dv L = \sum_i^n \dv l_i = \sum_i^n \v r_i \times \v F_i 
\\]

which is the net torque on the whole system. Since the net torque on a system is zero, the total angular momentum is constant.  

Angular momentum and the CoM: the conservation of angular momentum depends on the reference frame, but as it turns out the same result holds if $\v L$ is measured about the centre of mass. 

This is useful in analytic solutions to the problem as it means the coordinates don't have to be measured w.r.t. some fixed reference frame---everything can be measured relative to the centre of mass. 

## energy considerations

The n-body problem generally considers conservative forces only. This is a property that arises if the force depends only on position and can be derived from a correspondingly position-dependent potential field. Gravitational fields and electric fields are both examples of scalar potential fields. 

A scalar potential $U$ is defined such that $\v F(\v r) = -\grad U(\v r)$. For bodies in a gravitational field the potential is:

\\[
U(\v r) = -\frac{ G m_i m_j }{ r_{ij} } 
\\] 

The gravitational potential is a source of mechanical energy. The other source is kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy is

\\[
T = \sum_i^n \frac 12 m_i \dv r_i^2
\\] 

and the total mechanical energy of the system is

\\[
E = T + U
\\]

Since the system is isolated, the total energy is conserved, and the Hamiltonian is also conserved:

\\[
\Ham = T + U = E
\\]

Energy conservation is lost once a system interacts with the rest of the universe. adding friction forces and other nonconservative forces will give the potential function a time dependence, and the Hamiltonian will have a different form. 

## general relativity 

The Newtonian model of planetary motion breaks down when considering general relativity. The effects of general relativity are mostly negligibly small in the solar system, with the exception of Mercury's orbit which follows an unusual perihelion precession pattern that cannot be explained by Newtonian mechanics. General relativity is non-conservative and to build a model that accounts for it requires modelling non-conservative forces. This is much less trivial than the n-body problem under Newtonian gravitation, as the potential field in general relativity is a time-dependent vector field. 

## dynamical stability

For a system in dynamic equilibrium, the virial theorem states that the long term average of the $\ddd I t = 0$.
